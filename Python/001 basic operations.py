# Basic operations in python 

# >>> 2 + 3
# 5   

# >>> 9 - 8
# 1
    
# >>> 2 * 3
# 6

# This is float division   
# >>> 2/3 
# 0.6666666666666666

# This is integer division
# >>> 2 // 3
# 0

# This is power
# >>> 2 ** 3
# 8

# >>> 10 % 3
# 1

# Applying brackets also works
# >>> (9 + 10) * 2
# 38

# Else precedence is being followed
# >>> 9 + 10 * 2
# 29


print("Guneet")
print('Guneet')
print("Guneet's laptop")
print('''"These are triple quotes in python", said Ramesh's dad''')

# Another way to skip the special meaning of quotes is by using back slash (\)
print('Guneet\'s laptop')

# Strings can be concatenated using the + sign
print("Guneet" + "Malhotra")

# If you want a space, you have to give it
print("Guneet" + " Malhotra")

# Multiplication also works for string concatenation
print("abc" * 10)

# Special symbol \n -> leave a line
print("C:\new\docs")

# To avoid the special meaning of \, we can use raw tring i.e. r
print(r"C:\new\docs")
